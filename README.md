# QTM Toolbox
This repository holds the Python QTM Toolbox that can be used for transport measurements with equipment as used in the QTM/ICE research group. 

## Measurement tools
The repository contains different files and folders, organised in the following manner:
* **Measurement_script.py** is the main file of the project and is the starting point of each experiment. For every new experiment, create a new copy of this file and change it to reflect your current measurement setup.
* **functions** contains the QTMlab.py script that contains basic functions such as _move_, _sweep_, _measure_. 
* **instruments** contains definitions for all instruments that can be used during measurements. 

## Plot tools
The repository contains a simple plot tool that can plot live measurements. The tool can also quickly plot other (i.e. older) data files, as long as they are generated by the QTM Toolbox.
* **QTMplot.pyw** is the plot tool. The tool should be launched from the _pythonw.exe_ of your installed Python distribution.

A screenshot of the plot tool is shown below.

**Tips** 

The plot tool has a few useful keyboard shortcuts!
* Ctrl+O : pop up the 'Open file dialog' (also stops live plotting)
* Ctrl+R : rescale figure once
* Ctrl+A : enable auto rescale: the figure will continuously rescale when new data is added through the live plotting
* Ctrl+L : toggle live plotting on/off

## Requirements / Installation
To run the QTMtoolbox, we recommend the installation of Python 3.x through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). To use the live plotting tool as a standalone application, tick "Add Anaconda to system PATH" during the installation of Anaconda, or edit the Environment Variables manually (see below).

By using the Anaconda prompt, install the following packages
* pyqt5
* pyqtgraph
* pyvisa
* pyserial

**System environment variables**:
If you need to manually add the Python path to the system variables (this enables you to open cmd.exe and type 'python', which is required for the QTMplot to work as a standalone application), add the following paths. Here, we assume that Anaconda is installed in C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3.
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\bin
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\mingw-x64\bin
- C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\usr\bin

## Documentation
A manual is supplied to help new users to setup their measurements. The manual also contains an overview of all instruments, functions, etc.
* **Manual** is a PDF file containing detailed information about how to use this Toolbox.


_The .gitignore file tells GitLab that certain files / folder should not be uploaded to this repository (such as personal configuration files) and can be ignored._
